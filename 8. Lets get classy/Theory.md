## Q: Why do we use `super(props)` in constructor?
ANS:`super(props)` is used to inherit the properties and access of variables of the React parent class when we initialize our component.
super() is used inside constructor of a class to derive the parent's all properties inside the class that extended it. If super() is not used, then Reference Error : Must call super constructor in derived classes before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor is thrown in the console.
The main difference between super() and super(props) is the this.props is undefined in child's constructor in super() but this.props contains the passed props if super(props) is used.


## Q: Why do we use `componentDidMount`?

A: The `componentDidMount()` method allows us to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model). This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e after the component is rendered.
Wwe can run any piece of react code to modify the components. For ex. It's the best place to `make API calls`.
