        <h1>This is inside root</h1>
        <!-- What ever we write inside this root gets replaced by the react code done by root.render() method. Javascript starts reading
        line by line from index.html reads <h1>This is inside root</h1> and prints the statement in the browser. Then it reads about 
        react and react-dom from the cdn link and ultimately goes to app.js . Inside App.js react sees that root.render() is asking to 
        render something else controlled by react. Hence it replaces whatever was written inside the div tag with root with whatever 
        root.render method is asking to display. Hence on refreshing the page, we get to see "This is inside root" displaying for 
        few miliseconds and then displaying the content by root.render method-->
