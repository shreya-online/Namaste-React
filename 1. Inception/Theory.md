### What is Emmet?
Ans: Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors that greatly improves HTML and CSS workflow. It's essentially a shorthand system that allows developers to write large chunks of code quickly and efficiently. Emmet uses an abbreviation system that expands into full-fledged HTML or CSS code.
Example ->
Type html:5 and press Tab to generate a basic HTML5 template:
```
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                <title>Document</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                
            </body>
            </html>
```

### Q: What is CDN? Why do we use it?
Ans: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of geographically distributed servers that work together to deliver web content to users more efficiently. Instead of serving content from a single origin server, CDNs cache static content, such as images, CSS files, JavaScript files, videos, and other types of web assets, on multiple servers located in different geographic locations.

When a user requests content from a website or web application, the CDN delivers the content from the server that is geographically closest to the user, reducing latency and speeding up content delivery. This distributed approach to content delivery improves website performance, enhances scalability, and provides better reliability and availability.

CDNs offer several key benefits:

1. Faster Content Delivery: By serving content from servers located closer to users, CDNs reduce the time it takes to retrieve and load web pages, resulting in faster page load times and improved user experience.
2. Improved Website Performance: CDNs help offload traffic from origin servers, reducing their load and improving overall website performance and responsiveness, especially during periods of high traffic or traffic spikes.
3. Scalability: CDNs can handle large volumes of traffic and scale dynamically to accommodate fluctuations in demand, ensuring consistent performance and availability even under heavy load.
4. Redundancy and Reliability: CDNs offer redundancy and failover capabilities, ensuring high availability and reliability. If one CDN server goes down or experiences issues, requests can be automatically rerouted to other healthy servers in the network, minimizing downtime and service disruptions.
5. Security: Many CDNs provide security features such as DDoS protection, web application firewalls, SSL/TLS encryption, and content security policies, helping to protect websites and web applications from various cyber threats and attacks.
